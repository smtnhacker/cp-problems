# CP Progress Tracker Site

![Builds Status](https://github.com/smtnhacker/cp-problems/actions/workflows/running-tests.yml/badge.svg)

[Live Site Link](https://fave-cp-prob.web.app/)

A site that can be used to track competitive programming progress. Its primary use is to track skills and suggest problems depending on skill level.

But, you can also share your insights regarding the problems you have solved!

_Note: The blogging feature is currently in experimental stage so it is still very buggy._

Currently, the site supports CodeForces account syncing and its tags and difficulty scale is based on CodeForces', but other online judges may be incorporated in the future!

## About the Project

I started this project as a practice for CI/CD, front-end only web app, as well as testing (this is the first project I've made that has testing).

## Roadmap

Currently, the project is still in its alpha, so it's still very buggy (I plan on fixing essential bugs, of course). It's currently not released for mass usage yet so it has very limiting restrictions, such as currently only having a max of 100 users and very small bandwidth. Depending on how it goes, I may release it for general use. 

It is still a side project so development may be slow, but I still intend to add the following features:

- [ ] Mobile Support
- [ ] Inline KaTex
- [ ] Filter / Search Bar in the My Problems section

The project still lacks numerous features, so I'm thinking of adding these, but it's not guaranteed since adding a new feature can be quite a commitment.

- [ ] AtCoder API Support
- [ ] CodeChef API Support
- [ ] Automatic Fetching of recent submissions
- [ ] Viewing of another user's skill set
- [ ] Subtags (such as having MST under Graphs, Centroid Decomposition under DS, etc...)
- [ ] Language-specific code blocks
- [ ] More Login/Signup options
- [ ] Submission History (by tags)

Due to lack of resources and/or interest, the following features are unlikely to be added:

- [ ] Uploading of any kind of resources (such as images)
- [ ] Comments system
- [ ] Contest Tracker
